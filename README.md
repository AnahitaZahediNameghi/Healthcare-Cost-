Healthcare Cost Analysis Through T-SQL Language:

Dataset contains info about personal cost in the realm of healthcare services. I analyzed it through T-SQL language in SQL Server DB. Here's a brief overview of what I did
and some significant insights I obtained via writing queries:

1) Average Charges by Region
2) Average BMI by Age Group
3) Percentage of Smokers by Region
4) Charges by Number of Children
5) Top 5 People with Highest Insurance Charges
6) Average Charges by Smoker Status
7) Correlation Between Age and Charges
8) Impact of Number of Children on Charges for Smokers vs. Non-Smokers
9) Total Charges by Region and Smoker Status
10) Most Expensive Charges by Region
11) Count of Smokers vs. Non-Smokers
12) Total Charges by Age and Smoker Status
13) Average Charges by Region, Sex, and Smoking Status
14) Insurance Charges by Number of Children and Region
15) Regions with Highest Average BMI
16) Regions with Most Non-Smokers
